# Prompts Used for VibeMeter Development

This document contains all the prompts used to create the America's Got Talent-style voting system. Each prompt was carefully crafted to achieve specific development goals.

## 1. Initial Planning and Architecture

### Prompt 1: Project Setup and Dependencies

```
Please create rules and plan for this test task and best pattern

Test Assignment:
Build a system that allows the public to vote live for contestants during an America's Got Talent-style show.
The app should display a list of active contestants, let users cast limited votes during a live voting window, and update in real time to reflect current vote trends or statuses.
It should be reliable, responsive across devices, and handle failure gracefully.
Use React with NextJS

What we will look for:
1. Create reusable custom hooks to manage contestant voting logic, ensuring state is isolated per contestant and scalable across the app.
2. Implement error boundaries to catch and display fallback UIs when parts of the app fail, such as data fetch or vote submission.
3. Design a responsive layout so the voting interface adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
4. Validate and handle form input to enforce vote limits, prevent duplicate votes, and give clear user feedback on errors.
5. Simulate live data updates (e.g. changing vote counts) using polling or timers to mimic real-time voting behavior.
6. Structure components and state to reflect a clean separation of concerns and testable logic.
7. Gracefully handle loading and failure states so the system remains usable and informative even under degraded conditions.

Deliver:
1. Proper specification: business and technical
2. All prompts used to code the assignment
3. Folder with the app
4. Tests that the "Vote" button disables after voting and remains disabled even after a page reload, using localStorage to persist vote state
