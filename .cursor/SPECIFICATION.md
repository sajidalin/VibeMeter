- I want to see real-time vote trends so I can make show decisions
- I want the system to be reliable so the show isn't interrupted
- I want vote data to be accurate so results are trustworthy

#### As a Contestant

- I want to see my vote count in real-time so I know how I'm performing
- I want fair voting so all contestants have equal opportunity

### 1.4 Functional Requirements

- [x] Allow users to vote for one contestant
- [x] Prevent duplicate votes per contestant
- [x] Persist vote state across page reloads
- [x] Real-time vote count updates
- [x] Voting window control (open/closed)

#### User Interface

- [x] Responsive design for mobile, tablet, desktop
- [x] Clear vote button states (available, voted, disabled)
- [x] Loading states during vote submission
- [x] Error messages for failed operations
- [x] Live update indicators

#### Data Management

- [x] Simulated live data updates
- [x] Error handling for network issues
- [x] Graceful degradation during failures
- [x] localStorage for vote persistence

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with localStorage persistence

### 2.2 Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Custom Hooks Pattern

```typescript
// Isolated voting logic per contestant
const { hasVoted, isSubmitting, error, submitVote, canVote } =
  useContestantVoting(contestant);

// Live data management with polling
const { data, loading, error, retry } = useLiveData();

// localStorage persistence
const { votingState, updateVotingState, hasVotedForContestant } =
  useLocalStorage();
```

#### 2. Error Boundary Pattern

```typescript
// Catches errors in component tree
<ErrorBoundary>
  <App />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### 3. Responsive Design Pattern

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.contestant-grid {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr); /* Mobile */
}

@media (min-width: 641px) {
  .contestant-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Tablet */
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  .contestant-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Desktop */
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Data Flow

#### Vote Submission Flow

1. User clicks vote button
2. Hook validates vote eligibility
3. API call submits vote
4. localStorage updated with vote state
5. UI reflects new vote status
6. Error handling for failures

#### Live Data Flow

1. App initializes with loading state
2. API fetches initial contestant data
3. Polling starts every 5 seconds
4. Vote counts update in real-time
5. Error boundaries catch failures
6. Retry mechanism for recovery

### 2.4 Performance Requirements

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Vote Submission**: < 1 second
- **Real-time Updates**: Every 5 seconds
- **Mobile Performance**: Smooth 60fps scrolling
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for typical usage

### 2.5 Security Requirements

- **Vote Validation**: Prevent duplicate votes
- **Data Integrity**: Accurate vote counting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs

## 3. Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 90% coverage for hooks and utilities
- **Component Tests**: All interactive components
- **Integration Tests**: Vote submission flow
- **localStorage Tests**: Persistence across reloads

### 3.2 Key Test Scenarios

#### Vote Button States

```typescript
it('disables vote button after voting', () => {
  // Test that button becomes disabled and shows "Voted âœ“"
});

it('persists vote state across page reload', () => {
  // Test localStorage persistence
});
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
it('handles network errors gracefully', () => {
  // Test error boundaries and fallback UIs
});

it('provides retry mechanism', () => {
  // Test retry functionality
});
```

### 3.3 Test Implementation

- **Jest**: Test runner and mocking
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **localStorage Mocking**: Browser storage simulation
- **API Mocking**: Network request simulation

## 4. Deployment Requirements
